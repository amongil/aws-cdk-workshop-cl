      <google-codelab-step label="Introduction" duration="5">
        <p>When defining Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in AWS, writing YAML CloudFormation templates is probably the most common choice among Enterprises. Main reason being that CloudFormation is a first-class service in the AWS ecosystem. It is completely integrated with all the other services in the platform and keeps getting updates and improvements over time.</p>
<p>But YAML is not a programming language and the usual method of collaboration and sharing of templates is copy-pasting existing templates and adapting those to fit your current needs. This makes the process of describing the infrastructure for a new project or even updating an existing one tedious and very prone to human error. There has not existed an official tool for describing and deploying CloudFormation stacks and AWS resources programmatically, and the community has turned to third-party tools like <a href="https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere" target="_blank">troposphere</a> in order to get benefits from a high level language like Python, but it does come with its own issues, like being behind on CloudFormation-supported services, updates, and some inconsistency in parameter naming.</p>
<p>That was the situation until now, that AWS releases its <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/" target="_blank">CDK</a>, or Cloud Development Kit.</p>
<p>AWS CDK gives you the expressive power of programming languages for defining infrastructure. Familiar features such as objects, loops, and conditions accelerate your development process. You can also use AWS CDK with your integrated development environment (IDE) to take advantage of existing productivity tools and testing frameworks.</p>
<p>As of August 2019, languages supported are TypeScript, Python, Java (developer preview), and .NET (developer preview).</p>
<aside class="special"><p>This workshop will be based off the TypeScript libraries.</p>
</aside>
<p>This workshop aims to showcase some of the features that makes the CDK unique (such as <em>constructs</em> and <em>aspects</em>) and to prove how they can solve some common challenges, such as corporate compliance, collaboration in development, reusability of templates, testing, and automated CI/CD processes.</p>

        <h2 is-upgraded>Constructs</h2>
<p>Constructs are the basic building blocks of AWS CDK apps. A construct represents a &#34;cloud component&#34; and encapsulates everything AWS CloudFormation needs to create the component. A construct can represent a single resource, such as an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, or it can represent a higher-level component consisting of multiple AWS CDK resources. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html" target="_blank">1</a></p>
<p>The CDK comes included with a <em>Constructs library</em>, which provides low-level CloudFormation resources and also high-level Constructs based off these but which include certain fixed functionalities (e.g. a default-encrypted S3 bucket or a lifecycle policy applied to it).</p>
<p><strong>Construct classes extend other Constructs.</strong></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Aspects</h2>
<p>Aspects are the way to apply an operation to all constructs in a given scope. The functionality could modify the constructs, such as by adding tags, or it could be verifying something about the state of the constructs, such as ensuring that all buckets are encrypted. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/aspects.html" target="_blank">2</a></p>
<p><strong>Construct classes implement Aspects.</strong></p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Importing and deploying existing CDK Constructs" duration="15">
        <p>We are going to use the CDK CLI to create our first CDK application. It will consist of an S3 bucket Construct provided by the Construct Library.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir my-first-cdk-app &amp;&amp; cd my-first-cdk-app
cdk init --language typescript
</code></pre>
<p>Check the files created under the <em>bin</em> and <em>lib</em> folders. They hold the App and the Stack resources.</p>
<p>Next, let&#39;s check our tools are working properly by building and synthetising our code to a CloudFormation template.</p>
<pre><code>npm run-script build
cdk synth
</code></pre>
<p>You should see an empty stack with just metadata information.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s now add our resource, an S3 bucket.</p>
<p>First, we need to install the S3 library using npm...</p>
<pre><code>npm install @aws-cdk/aws-s3
</code></pre>
<p>Add the following snippet to the Stack file under the lib folder, which will contain our resources.</p>
<pre><code>// The code that defines your stack goes here
const bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, &#39;MyBucket&#39;);
</code></pre>
<aside class="special"><p>Don&#39;t forget to import the S3 library!</p>
</aside>
<p>Let&#39;s take a look at the CloudFormation template again:</p>
<pre><code>npm run-script build
cdk synth
</code></pre>
<p>You should see the S3 bucket resource added to your CloudFormation template.</p>
<p>We have mentioned before how we can have higher-order constructs which mask the underlying CloudFormation resources (like the S3 bucket resource we have just created) or how we could access directly the low-level CloudFormation resources. Let&#39;s see the diferences for ourselves and add a CfnBucket low-level resource to our stack. Add the following lines to your stack file:</p>
<pre><code>const cfnBucket = new s3.CfnBucket(this, &#39;MyCfnBucket&#39;);
</code></pre>
<p>If we build and <em>synth</em> again we can see how the two buckets have different properties, the Construct Library higher-order S3 construct has set up some policy attributes for us, even though we have created both the high-order and low-level construct resources without any properties. <strong>Masking and abstracting properties and functionalities from the consumer is one of the strengths of the CDK</strong>.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s deploy our Stack now!</p>
<pre><code>cdk deploy
</code></pre>
<p>Easy as that.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Authoring CDK Constructs" duration="5">
        <aside class="special"><p>We are going to write an NPM library that is going to be imported by our client application. For that, we are going to host our code in Github instead of publishing it on the NPM registry. We are going to omit git-related commands on this tutorial.</p>
</aside>
<p>Now that we&#39;ve learned about high-order and low-order constructs and how to consume them in our stacks, It&#39;s time to create our first Construct and publish it as a NPM library which can then be consumed by a client application.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Creating our Construct class</h2>
<p>The same way we did back when creating our first app, we can use the CDK CLI to create our library, but we have to specify that we want to create a library now:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir cdk-workshop-golden-constructs &amp;&amp; cd cdk-workshop-golden-constructs
cdk init lib --language=typescript
</code></pre>
<aside class="special"><p>See how we no longer have an app class and how the class that extends the Construct is exported</p>
</aside>
<p>The context for our example is going to be the following: a central Cloud Architecture team is going to provide golden resources to the rest of the organization. These resources are going to adhere to a set of compliance policies that are going to be enforced on the resources through implemented Aspects.</p>
<p>To examplarize, we are going to build a Construct for a Production PostgreSQL RDS instance that adheres to the following compliance requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>MultiAZ enabled</li>
<li>Storage encrypted with default or with provided KMS key (clients consuming this construct will have the freedom to choose which)</li>
<li>Must be tagged with the <em>Department</em> key</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#39;re going to slightly change the structure that the CLI creates for us. We are going to have a TypeScript file for each class that we are going to export (one .ts file for RDS in our case) and then an index.ts that will export the classes on those files.</p>
<p>So the structure of our lib folder will be the following:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Golden Lib Folder Structure" src="img/5a4553aebc6311ba.png"></p>
<p>Contents of index.ts:</p>
<pre><code>export * from &#39;./rds&#39;;
</code></pre>
<p>Contents of rds.ts:</p>
<pre><code>import cdk = require(&#39;@aws-cdk/core&#39;);
import rds = require(&#39;@aws-cdk/aws-rds&#39;);


export interface ProductionPostgresqlProps {}

export class ProductionPostgresql extends cdk.Construct {
  public readonly productionPostgresql: rds.CfnDBInstance;

  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props: ProductionPostgresqlProps) {
    super(scope, id);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<aside class="special"><p>Don&#39;t forget to install and save the dependency for aws-rds with <code>shell npm install --save @aws-cdk/aws-rds</code></p>
</aside>
<p>So let&#39;s go ahead and build first the RDS resource for the PostgreSQL instance and then implement the mentioned Aspects on a later stage. We will make use of the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-rds-readme.html" target="_blank">reference documentation</a> and, since we are going to be creating raw low-level CloudFormation resources, the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/es_es/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html" target="_blank">CloudFormation reference</a> too.</p>
<pre><code>import cdk = require(&#39;@aws-cdk/core&#39;);
import rds = require(&#39;@aws-cdk/aws-rds&#39;);


export interface ProductionPostgresqlProps {}

export class ProductionPostgresql extends cdk.Construct {
  public readonly productionPostgresql: rds.CfnDBInstance;

  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props: ProductionPostgresqlProps) {
    super(scope, id);

    this.productionPostgresql = new rds.CfnDBInstance(this, &#39;productionPostgresql&#39;, props);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is going to be our constructor to create a low-level CloudFormation general-purpose RDS Instance. Next, we will apply a database engine to the Construct and some compliance constraints too.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Implementing Aspects</h2>
<p>In this section we are going to implement a total of 4 Aspects with the following goals:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Select the DB engine and pin it to a specific version</li>
<li>Enforce MultiAZ compliance rule</li>
<li>Check encryption compliance rule</li>
<li>Check tagging compliance rule</li>
</ol>
<h3 is-upgraded>Select the DB engine and pin it to a specific version</h3>
<pre><code>class RdsPostgresqlEngine implements cdk.IAspect {
    public visit(node: cdk.IConstruct): void {
      if (node instanceof rds.CfnDBInstance) {
        node.engine = &#39;postgres&#39;;
        node.engineVersion = &#39;11.4&#39;
      }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 is-upgraded>Check MultiAZ compliance rule</h3>
<pre><code>class RdsMultiAzEnabled implements cdk.IAspect {
    public visit(node: cdk.IConstruct): void {
      if (node instanceof rds.CfnDBInstance) {
        node.multiAz = true
      }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 is-upgraded>Check encryption compliance rule</h3>
<pre><code>class RdsEncryptionChecker implements cdk.IAspect {
  public visit(node: cdk.IConstruct): void {
    if (node instanceof rds.CfnDBInstance) {
      if (!node.storageEncrypted) {
        node.node.addError(&#39;Database storage encryption must be enabled&#39;);
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 is-upgraded>Check tagging compliance rule</h3>
<pre><code>class RdsTagsChecker implements cdk.IAspect {
  public visit(node: cdk.IConstruct): void {
    if (node instanceof rds.CfnDBInstance) {
      var tags: string[] = [];
      for (let tagObject of node.tags.renderTags()) {
        tags.push(tagObject[&#39;key&#39;])
      }
    
      if (!(tags.includes(&#39;Department&#39;))) {
          node.node.addError(&#39;You must specify the \&#39;Department\&#39; tag for your DynamoDB CfnTable construct&#39;);
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next we&#39;re going to <strong>apply</strong> the Aspects to our Construct like this:</p>
<pre><code>  //...(constructor function)
    this.productionPostgresql = new rds.CfnDBInstance(this, &#39;productionPostgresql&#39;, props);
    this.node.applyAspect(new RdsMultiAzEnabled())
    this.node.applyAspect(new RdsPostgresqlEngine())
    this.node.applyAspect(new RdsEncryptionChecker())
    this.node.applyAspect(new RdsTagsChecker())
</code></pre>
<p>Our library is ready to be consumed by the client application.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Consuming our Construct class</h2>
<p>NPM allows us to directly install an NPM library from a GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Create a new repo for our client application and install the Construct library as a dependency.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir cdk-workshop-client-app &amp;&amp; cd cdk-workshop-client-app
cdk init --language typescript
npm install amongil/cdk-workshop-golden-constructs
</code></pre>
<p>We can now in our client app source file import it like this at the top of the file:</p>
<pre><code>import rds = require(&#39;cdk-poc-corporate-constructs/lib/rds&#39;);
</code></pre>
<p>We could create a resource like this:</p>
<pre><code>new rds.ProductionPostgresql(this, &#39;MyProductionPostgresql&#39;, {
    dbInstanceClass: &#39;db.t2.medium&#39;,
    allocatedStorage: &#39;10&#39;,
    masterUsername: &#39;myUser&#39;,
    masterUserPassword: &#39;myPassword&#39;,
    dbName: &#39;cdkpocpostgres&#39;,
    storageEncrypted: true,
    tags: [
        {
            key: &#39;Department&#39;,
            value: &#39;AI Factory&#39;,
        },
    ],
});
</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Writing tests for our CDK Application</h2>
<p>The AWS CDK gives us an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/typescript/api/assert.html" target="_blank">asserts library</a> to simplify the creation of our unit tests. Here we are going to use Jest for the framework and this library to create the assertions. The process is the following: we create an app, define an stack and add resources to it, then we assert certain properties against this collection of resources.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s continue with our compliance-met production PostgreSQL instance example from before and write a test to check the engine version:</p>
<pre><code>test(&#39;test engine version is 11.4 for a production postgresql instance&#39;, () =&gt; {
  const stack = new cdk.Stack();

  const postgres = new rds.ProductionPostgresql(stack, &#39;MyProdPostgres&#39;, {
    dbInstanceClass: &#39;db.t2.micro&#39;
  });
  
  expect(stack).to(haveResource(&#39;AWS::RDS::DBInstance&#39;, {
    EngineVersion: &#39;11.4&#39;
  }))
});
</code></pre>
<aside class="special"><p>Writing unit tests in our client application that consume other libraries is important if we are going to use the <em>latest</em> version they publish. This way, we can always benefit from the latest bug fixes and features, while being sure that the core engines and properties that we are really dependant on stay the same.</p>
</aside>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="CDK Applications CI/CD with CircleCI" duration="5">
        <p>Now that our infrastructure is defined as code and as a TypeScript application, we can put it on the same lifecycle as any other software application. This means, CI/CD capabilities with linting, testing, building phase and deploy phase (with the help of the CDK CLI tool).</p>
<p>To achieve this, I have used CircleCI as it is really easy to hook with public GitHub repos. The workflow can be defined as follows:</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Conclusions" duration="0">
        <p>I truly find the AWS CDK a step up in the Infrastructure as Code paradigm. Writing real software applications, with unit tests and standard CI/CD practices is only going to make our infraestructure more robust and will engage the developers more when it comes to adhere to standards. With the asserts library, we can see the CDK comes with these ideas from start.</p>
<p>As an infrastructure developer, I hope we can move away from DSLs, .yaml files and use the AWS CDK as the base for infrastructure development within the AWS ecosystem and can&#39;t wait to see what the community will do with the CDK, finding new ways and bringing innovation.</p>
